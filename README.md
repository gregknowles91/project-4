Research Question: Which fuel types retain better value over time?

Data Cleaning:

Calculated and created a separate column for vehicle age

Merged datasets and cleaned columns: fuel_types, manufacturing_year, vehicle age, pricein_laks

Findings:

Petrol Fuel: Vehicle Age: Up to 18 years, Avg. Price: 247.3 Lakhs

Diesel Fuel: Vehicle Age: Up to 16 years, Avg. Price: 20.3 Lakhs

CNG Fuel: Vehicle Age: Up to 12 years, Avg. Price: 5.2 Lakhs

According to the data, petrol vehicles maintained the highest value in vehicle age and avg. price compared to diesel and CNG. This may be due to a higher demand for this fuel type as most vehicles use petrol. Diesel and CNG vehicles have a much lower avg. price, implying they are much lower in demand and may depreciate faster over time compared to petrol.


Bar Graph on Tableau: 

A horizontal bar graph was made on tableau with three bars color-coded by fuel type. The graph was split up into two sections displaying vehicle age and avg. price in lakhs. The user can interact with the data by hovering over each bar with their mouse and receiving a text box that displays vehicle type, avg. price in lakhs and fuel type.

According to the data, petrol vehicles maintained the highest value in vehicle age and avg. price compared to diesel and CNG. This may be due to a higher demand for this fuel type as most vehicles use petrol. Diesel and CNG vehicles have a much lower avg. price, implying they are much lower in demand and may depreciate faster over time compared to petrol.
